### Basic Introduction:

AntFlow is an open-source OA (Office Automation) approval workflow system inspired by Dingtalk's workflow design. Its interface is very simple,you only need some clicks to configure a workflow. It aims to solve the high usage threshold and complexity of traditional BPMN.js process designers, making it easy for non-technical users to get started and quickly configure daily approval processes.

> Use Case 1: In a large enterprise with thousands of employees, heavily relying on workflows (even getting a notebook or a pen requires a workflow), a single process operator can solve most problems without needing backend development intervention.
